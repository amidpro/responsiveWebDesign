      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of my Life and my career in Tech so far:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1994</strong> - Born in Accra, Ghana</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1996</strong> - Moved to the UK at the age of 2, travelled with Mother as Father was already a UK citizen
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1997</strong> - First time being a big sister and first ever sibling and friend, Little sister "Nay" was born. Also the year Princess Diana diedðŸŒ¹, vividly remember watching her funeral 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1999</strong> - I still smile remembering the joy it brought me knowing that I was going to have a little brother, Little brother "T" was born
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2000</strong> - The Millenium - The first time I consciously remember thinking that the world was going to end ðŸ˜…
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2001</strong> - Yet another time I thought the world was going to end (9-11ðŸŒ¹)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2003</strong> - Started learning how to use a computer properly (Paint, Word Documents, PowerPoint), how mini robots worked, taking basic photographs and videos with family camera and what type of music was good or not lol. I enjoyed Science, and understanding how things worked. Hold tight my Parents and Gateway ðŸ¤ž
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2005</strong> - Last year of primary school, first year of high school - a major transition in my personal life and the end of an era of my enjoyment for education. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2006</strong> - Started to care more about what people thougt of me and who I thought I wanted to be. Also started exploring the world of being Online, Graphic Design, Aesthetics and social networks. S/O's to Piczo and Bebo. MSN too. The era of Happy slaps, tfl bus journeys and infra-red data sharing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2007</strong> - Started messing around with MySpace layouts/HTML. Low level hacking. Bluetooth and flip phones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2009</strong> - Facebook. Blackberry Messengers and Funky House.
        </li>
        <li><strong>2010</strong> - Sweet 16: Tumblr and Hormones. Again still consumed with how I fit in the world and what I think I want to be - Still designing in my spare time and exploring the Online World</li>
        <li>
          <strong>2012</strong> - 18 - First year of "Independance" - Last year of high school, first year of Uni - Battles of being an 18 year old - STILL no real clear idea of what I actually want to do - again thought the world was going to end lol
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2014</strong> - Uni Drop out - started working in retail whilst trying to figure out how to turn my basic Web Design hobbying into a career.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2015</strong> - 21: Got my foot into Tech (Network Engineer), Dad died also ðŸŒ¹ I was still creating content in my free time (attempted to use Dad's death as a creative muse, maybe should've just actually greieved instead lol, instead of run away from feelings that were inevitable). Anyways, ideally I wanted to do creative apprenticeship but in all honesty, they were and still are extremely hard to get into, would still recommend apprenticeships over degrees from my personal experience of both. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>2017</strong> - First junior career job in Tech - Started my own business - not long after, due to undealt with emotions and stress I inevitably had a mental breakdown; severe anxiety and depression</li>
        <li><strong>2019</strong> - On the road to recovery - Introduction to Meditation - Birthday Trip to Thailand - Attempt at starting a business AGAIN</li>
        <li><strong>2020</strong> - Started a course in hopes of becoming a Project Manager (very ambitious) - COVID (keyworker) - Another mental breakdown, this time it was global, anoter time where I thought the world might end ðŸŒ¹ </li>
        <li><strong>2021</strong> - Another crack at career development - messed up a FAANG interview "on purpose" aka imposter syndrome aka self sabotage (that's what I tell myself anyway) - Anyways, started doing Free Google courses, Digital Marketing and UX Design</li>
        <li><strong>2022</strong> - Currently completing Get into Tech, Women in Tech 15 week Bootcamp with the aim of becoming a Software Developer ðŸ¤ž</li>
